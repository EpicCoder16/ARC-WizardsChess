## Path Planning
- This code handles chess game management, path planning, and sending instructions to robots
- All chess logic is done using the python chess library: https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Control Code
- This is the code running on the raspberry pi picos and ESP01 wireless module
- "UDPSocketESP.ino" is uploaded to the ESP01 wireless transceiver
    - Opens a UDP connection to the "wizardschess" wifi network (password is same as network name)
        - you must set up the router and connect to this network to connect to the ESP from a computer
    - Communicates with pico using UART (TX and RX pins)
- "casePicoWirelessControl.ino" is uploaded to the raspberry pi pico on the robot
    - Listens for communication from serial port (connected to ESP)
    - 1st byte of data received from port = command executed (move, turn, stop)
    - Other bytes of data received from port = parameters (direction/distance, angle, duration of stop)

## Computer Vision
- This code detects positions of pieces using computer vision and april tags
- It defines a boundary rectangle by finding the april tags with specific IDs; this identifies the chess board
- Lines are then drawn using the 4 tags as reference to create every individual square on the board
- Other April Tags (which represent chess pieces) are then assigned to a region

## How it works:
1. game.py from path planning runs the chess game. It takes a move as input and sends it to a Wizboard object from wizboard.py.
2. Wizboard updates position of each piece and the chess game's state, and sends the move to PathPlanner object from path_planner.py
3. PathPlanner object determines how each robot must move to reflect the piece's new position on the chess board. These paths are returned to game.py
3. For each path, game.py calls:
    - path.piece.execute_path(path.points), which stores all of the instructions to send to the robot as an array of bytes
    - path.piece.send_buffer(), which uses code from PythonServer.py to send UDP packets over the "wizardschess" wifi network
4. Each piece's ESP recieves the UDP packet, then sends the data to the piece's Raspberry pi using UART.
5. The Raspberry pi interprets the packet as an instruction, and executes the moves using the control code

## To do:
1. Computer vision integration: 
    - the server should compare the robot's position (from computer vision) and ideal position (center of square or current position on path), and correct. For most accuracy, this should probably happen multiple times for each path. This could require some refactoring of robot_control.py. 
2. Accurate movement commands:
    - During gameplay, the amount the robots move / turn given a certain number of motor encoder counts is inconsistent, especially between different robots. Feedback from computer vision will help with this, but more solutions in the robot's control code is probably necessary.
    - the move_profile() function in the control code was a test at an idea of something to help this, implemented during last semester's last meeting. It is not finished. I do not remember if it worked, and if it did, I do not remember if it helped the problem at all.
3. Improved interface:
    - Right now, the game interface is just a python script running in the terminal. If somebody wanted to work on a better interface (display chess board, drag chess pieces, etc.), that would make the final product look a lot better.
          - to make moves in the current interface, write them in standard algebraic notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess))
    - Voice recognition and voice commands. This was part of original project description.
    - Play against chess bot. Right now, both players type moves.
          - The python chess library supports generating moves from an engine given the current board state. This would be very helpful for implementing this.

## Project Status Summary I guess via Chat GPT:
Current Status: The "Open Loop" System
Project currently functions as an "open-loop" system. This means the central computer can calculate moves and tell robots what to do, but it has no way of knowing if the robots actually did it correctly.

1. Game Logic & Path Planning (Completed) The "Brain" of the project is functional.

    - Chess Logic: The system uses the chess library to validate moves, check for checkmate/stalemate, and handle board state.

    Path Finding: The PathPlanner class successfully generates complex paths. It handles special cases like knights moving in "L" shapes, castling, and even instructing captured     pieces to leave the board.

    Voice Input: There is a working script (speech_movement.py) that uses the Sphinx library to listen for commands like "e2 to e4" and converts them into chess coordinates.

2. Communication Pipeline (Completed) The "Nervous System" connects your code to the hardware.

    - Server: PythonServer.py creates a UDP server that can send data packets to the robots over WiFi.

    - Robot Translation: robot_control.py translates abstract moves (e.g., "move to E4") into specific byte commands (e.g., [1, 0, distance_bytes]) that the hardware understands.

    - Hardware Code: You have the Arduino code (UDPSocketESP.ino) for the ESP chips to receive these packets and pass them to the robot's motor controllers.

What is Missing: The "Closed Loop"
The critical missing piece is the "Feedback Loop." Currently, the code assumes that if it tells a robot to move 10 inches, it moves exactly 10 inches. In reality, battery voltage, friction, or wheel slip will cause errors.

1. Computer Vision Integration (Critical Priority)

    - The Problem: The Robot class tracks position based on commands sent, not actual location. As noted in your Readme, game.py needs to query the computer vision system to see where the robot actually is.

    - The Fix: You need to update game.py to pause after sending a move, read the camera data (April Tags), calculate the error (e.g., "Robot is 2cm to the left of center"), and send a correction command.

2. Motor Accuracy & Calibration

    - The Problem: The Readme notes that "amount the robots move / turn ... is inconsistent".

    - The Fix: The move_profile() function mentioned in the Readme was an attempt to fix this but is unfinished. You likely need to implement a PID controller or a simple calibration factor for each specific robot ID to ensure "100 counts" equals the same distance on every robot.

3. Chess Bot Integration

    - The Problem: Currently, the game relies on two humans entering moves or speaking them.

    - The Fix: The Readme lists playing against a chess engine as a "To Do". You need to integrate a library like Stockfish into game.py so the computer can generate its own moves instead of waiting for a second player.

## New Pico 2 W task modules

The current task branches add a MicroPython motor driver, an RFID positioning
prototype, and a direct JSON/UDP Wi-Fi link. They are not yet connected to the
existing Arduino/ESP-01 byte-command path. See
[`TASK_BRANCH_INTEGRATION.md`](TASK_BRANCH_INTEGRATION.md) for interfaces,
missing Task 2/3 adapters, pin conflicts with legacy sketches, and testing and
hardware limits.
